## Research funder Article Processing Charge payment policies database

This repository aims to collect information on the policies of research funders towards the payment of Article Processing Charges (APCs). Initially this information will be recorded as a CSV file. This information is being collected as part of a dissertation on different approaches being taken by research funder towards the payment of APCs. It is very much non-comprehensive and incomplete. I aim to continue updating this until the completion of my dissertation and possibly beyond. 


### What information is being collected?

This is subject to change but currently the following is being recorded:

* Research funder name
* License required
* Fund APCs?
* Fund APCs for Hybrid?
* Maximum payment for APCs (converted into Euros)
* Maximum amount paid for hybrid APCs.
* Country	
* Type of funder	
* Direct Payment?	
* Consortium? 	
* Payment of block grants?	
* Source of policy
* Date policy last checked
* Comments
* Exchange rate used
* local currency values  

### Why is this needed?
This dataset aims to help address the question of what policy approaches research funders can (or should) take towards influencing the market for APCs, in particular with the aim of reducing the cost of APCs in hybrid journal. When research for information about research funder polices towards the payment of APCs I found limted sources that enabled me to compare this information. The most useful starting point for information has been the Registry of Open Access Mandates and Policies [(ROARMAP)](http://roarmap.eprints.org) published by the University of Southampton. This database includes information on open access mandates for different instituions and some information on policies towards APCs. However, detail on the specifics of the payment of APCs was not detailed enough to address my research questions.This collection arises primarily of my own need but may hopefully also be of use to other researchers. 


### Current criteria for inclusion 

There are a number of criteria that were chosen for being included:

* Institutions must fund research and make some payment towards APCs. This could be limited to Gold open access only or include Hybrid journal payments.  These funders currently include international and national government funders and charities. 

* Universities are currently not being collected primarily because university support for the payment of APCs often involves the administration of block grants. Updates may begin to collect information on university APC policies, especially if these universities administer their own payments. 

* Currently institutions have not been included if their policies are overly vague. It is possible that in the future I will endeavour to seek clarification from institutions pro actively but I am currently aiming to rely on published policies and guidance. 

* There is a bias towards research funders who have published policies in English or German. I would be very grateful for any additions made by people who are able to read policies in other languages.
